## About this Project

This project sets up a simple audio visualization using the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). 

The project covers basic git concepts, like cloning and branch switching. It also sets aside certain variables for attendees to interact with and change. By changing the color and shape of the animation, attendees can learn a bit about codingâ€”as well as audio concepts like frequency and decibels.
